A simple responsive investment calculator widget and shortcode.

== Description ==

The Responsive Investment Calculator is a jQuery widget and shortcode that's designed to fit easily into any theme, on any device, at any size. Quickly calculate accrued interest on a principal amount.

__Features__

The calculator allows your website visitors to estimate their accrued interest by entering:

* the principal amount
* an interest rate
* the investment term
* and optionally selecting a compounding period

The result is displayed below the form. Choose whether to display just the accrued interest amount or to display a more verbose result.

__Redesign It__

There are settings to adjust the styling, a light and a dark theme, or you can remove the styling entirely and use your theme’s styling. The HTML is built with plenty of classes, so it’s easy to override the included stylesheet with your own CSS. 

__Plenty of Options__

* Choose from a set of the interest rate compounding period.
* Set a fixed compounding period and hide the field from your users.
* Format currencies how you want with your own symbol, ISO code and number format.
* Set a default values for all the inputs.
* Rename the input labels.
* Add your own CSS classes.

__Localization__

The plugin is ready for translation. Please contact me to submit a translation.

__Known Issues__

The widget and shortcode rely on the same jQuery script, so use one or the other or you'll get interesting results.
